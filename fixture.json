        "text": "Sir Terence David John \"Terry\" Pratchett, OBE (28 April 1948 \u2013 12 March 2015) was an English author of fantasy novels, especially comical works.[2] He is best known for his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, The Carpet People, was published in 1971; after the first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in 1983, he wrote two books a year on average. His 2011 Discworld novel Snuff was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days.[3] His final Discworld novel, The Shepherd's Crown, was published in August 2015, five months after his death.\r\n\r\nPratchett, with more than 85 million books sold worldwide in 37 languages,[4][5] was the UK's best-selling author of the 1990s.[6][7] He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1998 and was knighted for services to literature in the 2009 New Year Honours.[8][9] In 2001 he won the annual Carnegie Medal for The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents, the first Discworld book marketed for children.[10][11] He received the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2010.\r\n\r\nIn December 2007, Pratchett announced that he was suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's disease.[12] He later made a substantial public donation to the Alzheimer's Research Trust[13] (now Alzheimer's Research UK), filmed a television programme chronicling his experiences with the disease for the BBC, and also became a patron for Alzheimer's Research UK.[14] Pratchett died on 12 March 2015, aged 66.",

        "title": "Fianarantsoa",
        "text": "Fianarantsoa is a city (commune urbaine) in south central Madagascar.\r\n\r\nFianarantsoa is the capital of Haute Matsiatra Region. It was built in the early 19th century by the Merina as the administrative capital for the newly conquered Betsileo kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIt is at an average altitude of 1,200 metres (3,900 ft), and has a population of 190,318 (2013 estimate).[1]\r\n\r\nFianarantsoa means \"Good education\" in Malagasy. It is a cultural and intellectual center for the whole island. It is home to some of the oldest Protestant and Lutheran cathedrals on the island, the oldest theological seminary (also Lutheran), as well as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Fianarantsoa. The city of \"good education\" also boasts a university named after it and built in 1972. Fianarantsoa is considered to be the capital of wine in Madagascar, because of the presence of many wine industries in the city.\r\n\r\nFianarantsoa has been known for its political activism and was one of the \"hot spots\" during the political crisis in 2002. Students of the University of Fianarantsoa have a reputation for sympathizing with radical leftist groups. The mayor of Fianarantsoa comes from the MFM political party whose colors are based on the anarcho-syndicalist flag.\r\n\r\nFianarantsoa was placed by the World Monuments Fund on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites because many of the buildings in the old town are in dire need of repair. Fortunately, most of the repairs are relatively easy, and WMF hopes that the listing will attract attention to fund the necessary repairs to keep the old town looking beautiful.",

        "title": "Matthaeus Greuter",
        "text": "Matthaeus Greuter (1564\u20131638), known in Italian as Matteo Greuter, was a German etcher and engraver who worked in Rome. He is known for his cartographical prints.\r\n\r\nBorn in Strasbourg, Greuter worked in France, in Avignon and Lyon. Apparently to escape the \"strong intellectual and commercial pressure of Dutch cartographic publishing\",[1] in 1606 he went to Rome where he produced works for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, Pope Paul V, for the Accademia dei Lincei, and Pope Urban VIII.[2]\r\n\r\nGreuter is best known for his plans and maps. He created architectural prints depicting Villa Mondragone, Villa Parisi and other notable buildings. He also produced a large number of maps, most notably those designed to be used for globes. His first globe map of the world was created in 1632 and was dedicated to Jacobo Boncompagno. It was based on an earlier globe by Willem Blaeu. The inclusion of Hokkaido indicates that he updated the design to take account of new discoveries, as the island was not known to Blaeu, but was documented by another map maker in Rome.\"[1] He made a \"celestial globe\" depicting the constellations in 1635, also based on Blaeu, who had used the data of Tycho Brahe. Again he appears to have updated the globe. He also designed reduced-size globes between 1636 and 1638.[1]\r\n\r\nOther works were book frontispieces, portraits and allegorical designs.[2] His satirical print of \"Doctor Wurmbrandt\" purging human follies was later adapted by Martin Droeshout.[3]",

He was shot-down, captured and subsequently imprisoned in a succession of prisoner of war camps in Germany before escaping and forming a network which assisted fellow escapers. Grimson remained on the run in the Third Reich, hunted by the Gestapo, but eventually disappeared probably having been captured and murdered by the SS in or after mid-April 1944 in the Danzig area.",
